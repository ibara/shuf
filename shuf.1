.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that outputs a random permutation of its input lines.
By default,
.Nm
reads from
.Ar stdin
and outputs to
.Ar stdout .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Use a space-separated list of command-line
.Ar args
as input.
.Pp
Cannot be combined with
.Fl i .
.It Fl h
Print usage information and exit.
.It Fl i Ar lo-hi
Use the range of positive integers from
.Ar lo
to
.Ar hi
as input.
.Pp
Cannot be combined with
.Fl e .
.It Fl n Ar count
Print at most
.Ar count
lines.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write output to
.Ar outfile
instead of
.Ar stdout .
.It Fl r
Do not permute.
Instead, choose lines at random, with replacement.
When used without
.Fl n ,
.Nm
repeats indefinitely.
.It Fl v
Print version information and exit.
.It Fl z
Delineate lines with the NUL character instead of the newline character.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Flip a coin ten times:
.Pp
.Dl shuf -e -n 10 -r Heads Tails
.Pp
Select five numbers from 10 to 20:
.Pp
.Dl shuf -i 10-20 -n 5
.Pp
Set a random desktop background image from the user's collection:
.Pp
.Dl ls ~/wallpaper | shuf -n 1 | feh --bg-fill
